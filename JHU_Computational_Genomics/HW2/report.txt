Problem: 1
==========
  
a)  bad character rule  : 1
    good suffix rule    : 7
b)  bad character rule  : 5
    good suffix rule    : 5
c)  bad character rule  : 4
    good suffix rule    : 1

Problem: 2
==========
Neither of the answers in problem-1 would change for strong good suffix rule.

Problem-3
=========
a) z8 = 4
b) aabaaabaa
c) Algorithm of suffix/prefix match:
    1. Contract S = b$a, where $ is a character that appear in neither a nor b.
    2. Calculate Zi(S) for i=1..(n+m+1).
    3. Find the minimum i such that Zi(S) = n+m+1-i+ 1.
    4. S[i:n+m+1] is the longest suffix of 'b' that matches with a prefix of 'a'.

Explanation: In 3rd step, Zi(S) = n+m+1-i+ 1 ensures that the substring of 'a' that matches with prefix of 'b' is actually a suffix of 'a'. The minimum of i ensures that the suffix is the longest.

Problem: 4
==========
Two reasons: 
i) I may have a mutation in the read. 
ii) The read may come from a different copy of chromosome which was not used in reference genome.

Problem: 5
==========
a)
Number of exact match   : 3
Number of 1-mismatch    : 3
Specificity             : 0.0583

b)
Number of exact match   : 36
Number of 1-mismatch    : 0
Specificity             : 0.2609

c)
Number of exact match   : 5
Number of 1-mismatch    : 64
Specificity             : 0.2584

Problem: 6
==========
a)
Number of exact match   : 3
Number of 1-mismatch    : 3
Specificity             : 0.6667

b)
Number of exact match   : 36
Number of 1-mismatch    : 0
Specificity             : 0.5

c)
Number of exact match   : 5
Number of 1-mismatch    : 64
Specificity             : 0.9324

Yes, there is a difference in specificity between consecutive substring and spaceed seed scheme. While substrings of 6 characters of P was frequent in T, subsequences of 6 characters (taking alternate character) was not so frequent in T. Thus, even though the number of approximate matches was equal, there is a difference in specificity.
