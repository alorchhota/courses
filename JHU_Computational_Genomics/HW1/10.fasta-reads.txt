a) The 67th row is suspicious. Often, the nucleotide was not identified (not A, C, G, or T). There can have a number of reasons behind this. The template string may be erroneous or contaminated. The sequencing machineries including image capturing machineries may be defective.

b) The number of quality values less than 20 gradually increases from one end to another. Multiple factors may result in this pattern. The sequence may reside towards a terminal of a chromosome. There can also have sequencing bias towards an end.
