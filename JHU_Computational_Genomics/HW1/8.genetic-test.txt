Genetic tests cannot be definitive whether a person will get lung cancer in future. They just predicts the 'probability' of having cancer based on history of genetically similar individuals. Generally, many genes works together to develop lung cancer. It is hard to predict the result of complex natures of many genes. Moreover, environmental factors can play a vial role which is absent in genetic test.
